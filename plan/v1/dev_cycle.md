PHASE 6 — Expand Carefully

Only after first playable:

Add:
	•	Second-hand market
	•	New builds with long lead times
	•	Scrapping
	•	Regulation shocks
	•	Harsh weather events

Never add more than one system at a time.

PHASE 7 — Graphics LAST

When to move to an engine

Only when:
	•	The simulation is fun without visuals
	•	You understand your own numbers

Then:
	•	Godot or Unity
	•	Isometric or flat UI
	•	Charts > animations
