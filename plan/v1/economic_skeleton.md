PHASE 2 — Economic Skeleton (this is the real start)

This is where most people don’t start — and why they fail.

3️⃣ Oil price & demand model (simple but powerful)

Oil price

Use a mean-reverting random walk:
	•	Long-term average (e.g. 70)
	•	Random shocks
	•	Slow reversion

Oil price does NOT directly control demand.

Demand (rig-years)

Demand lags price:
	•	Use a 6–12 month delay
	•	Smooth it

This alone creates:
	•	Overbuild
	•	Crashes
	•	Recoveries

💡 This model can live in a spreadsheet first.
